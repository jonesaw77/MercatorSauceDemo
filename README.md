# MercatorSauceDemo 🧪🚀

This is an end-to-end Python automation testing framework built to test [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/).  
It uses `pytest`, `selenium`, and follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to ensure clean structure, reusability, and maintainability.

Created by **Scott Jones** as part of a hands-on learning and interview-ready demonstration.
